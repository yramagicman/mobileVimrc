Castro, Druschel, Kermarrec, and Rowstron

Why does anyone care about multicast?

Why not use repeated unicast?

Why not flood like Gnutella?

How does Scribe form its distribution tree?

Why do the routes from members to rendezvous form a good tree?
  Minimum number of copies / Pastry nodes visited?
  Minimum distance on underlying Internet?

What if a node fails?
  How do children re-attach?
